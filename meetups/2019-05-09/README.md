#### [Marcel Ritter](http://marcel-ritter.com/) // Sphere Tessellation in OpenGL and F#
> Stemming from a computer graphics background, I was interested in stirring OpenGL via F# and compile to a multi-platform application. Based on the work on a viewer for molecular dynamics simulations written in C++, OpenGL and Imgui, the atoms viewing part was transformed into a point cloud viewer. Concepts from the F# world were applied with the code transformation, e.g. immutability, pipeline operation, record types for objects/states, state transition functions., ... The minimal code now compiles and runs in Windows and Linux, and provides helpers for OpenGL programming, to be discussed in the session. Also, the concept of the geometry generation is presented, being independent from the host programming language.

#### [Martin HÃ¤usler](https://twitter.com/MartinHusler) // Kotlin 101: An Introduction
> Kotlin is a relatively new programming language running primarily on the Java Virtual Machine. It mixes functional and object-oriented styles to great effect, while dropping a lot of boilerplate code which is required in Java. Combined with a powerful type system and syntactic sugar, Kotlin is a major boost in productivity while remaining fully interoperable with all existing Java code. In the talk, we will explore some language basics and features, as well as potential pitfalls for newcomers.
