#### [Marcel Ritter](http://marcel-ritter.com/) // Something with F# // âš¡
> Notes on an ongoing practical project for plotting, analyzing, classifying, and manual correction of high resolution eye tracking data with application in Neurology. Concepts, implementation, tools/libraries, and algorithms are shortly presented.

#### [Bernhard Mayr](https://twitter.com/bemayr) // Trapped in the wrong sense of safety - How developers can safely feel safe.
> Currently studying psychology and working part-time as a software architect really made me rethink the way we actually develop. Also moving into the alps made me want to write and architect my code as safe as possible, so that I don't have to think about it when I'm skiing or out with my friends. In this talk I will mainly show technologies and techniques for writing better code as well as a better way of writing code. I try to combine psychology, mathematics (FP stuff) and software engineering mostly in live-coding using examples as close to the real world as possible. Be prepared for some type magic, awesome dev tools and a bit of interdisciplinary psychology.

#### [Juan Luis Vicci](https://twitter.com/jnvicci) & [Bernhard Mayr](https://twitter.com/bemayr) // What's this <code>un&lt;meet&gt;up</code> thing?
> What is the unmeetup? Why did we start this? Where does it come from? What can it be? What do we want it to be? How can you help? It's our first unmeetup, so for sure we gonna have a few things to explain and discuss. Juan and Bernhard will present you the "unmeetup-idea" and would love to discuss where the unmeetup should head to, as it's called "The "crowd-organized" software engineering meetup based in Tirol, Austria." See you there! :)
